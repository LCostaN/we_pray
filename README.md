# we_pray

Ever felt like praying for someone, but didn't know who?
Ever felt like needing a prayer from someone else, but didn't know who to ask for?

Exactly for those situations, WePray was born as an app. Connecting people in need with
the people wishing to do a sincere pray is the reason this app exists.

If you ever feel like receiving God's blessing, all you need is to ask. If you already
received His blessings, then don't keep it to yourself and share with the ones needing it.
